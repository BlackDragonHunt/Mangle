Version 2.2:

* Updated from v2.1 by Jeremy Davidson (http://blackdragonhunt.wordpress.com/)

***Major Upgrades***
  * Added the option to export books to CBZ format.
  * Added the option to split images instead of rotating them to match the
    device's aspect ratio.
    * Note: Because of the nook color's unusual aspect ratio, average-sized
      manga pages tend to get split in half, and double pages tend to be
      split into three. You might have better luck using the regular nook
      profile if you want to split the wide pages.
  * Changed how "Draw frame around images" handles oversized images:
    Previously, oversized images would be cropped to the device's dimensions.
    Now a frame is added such that the image matches the device's aspect ratio.

***Minor Changes***
  * Added profiles for nook (600x730) and nook color (600x980).
    * Note: Since the nook color is, well, full-color, and palette reduction is
      unnecessary, the "dither" option uses the same palette as the regular
      nook/Kindle 3, if you want to use that for whatever reason.
    * Note: The nook color's resolution was selected based on this post:

      I figure it's more useful to size pages to the actual usable resolution,
      so the e-reader doesn't end up resizing it again before display.
  * Changed the wording on "Resize images" to more accurately reflect what it
    does: shrinks oversized images.
  * Added an option to enlarge images which are smaller than the selected
    device's resolution
    * Note: Shrinking images uses the PIL's antialias filter, and enlarging
      images uses the bicubic filter.
  * Added "Save Defaults" and "Restore Defaults" buttons to the options page.
    This allows you to change which options are set by default when creating a
    new book.
  * Fixed an issue where "Draw frame around images" left an extra pixel of
    empty space on the right and bottom between the image and the frame.
  * Fixed an issue with rotation which could add a row/column of black pixels
    along the top/left of an image.
  * Added a button to the toolbar which opens the options menu. (Icon provided
    by http://pixel-mixer.com)
  * The save/open dialogs now keep track of the last directory saved to/loaded
    from for as long as the program is open.
  * There may be some more I'm not remembering, but that's the gist of it.
