Version 2.2:

* Updated from v2.1 by Jeremy Davidson (http://blackdragonhunt.wordpress.com/)

***Major Upgrades***
  * Added the option to export books to CBZ format.
  * Added the option to split images instead of rotating them to match the
    device's aspect ratio.
  * Changed how "Draw frame around images" handles oversized images:
    Previously, oversized images would be cropped to the device's dimensions.
    Now a frame is added such that the image matches the device's aspect ratio.

***Minor Changes***
  * Added profiles for nook (600x730) and nook color (600x1024).
    * Note: Since the nook color is, well, full-color, and palette reduction is
      unnecessary, the "dither" option uses the same palette as the regular
      nook/Kindle 3, if you want to use that for whatever reason.
  * Changed the wording on "Resize images" to more accurately reflect what it
    does: shrinks oversized images.
  * Added an option to enlarge images which are smaller than the selected
    device's resolution
    * Note: Shrinking images uses the PIL's antialias filter, and enlarging
      images uses the bicubic filter.
  * Added "Save Defaults" and "Restore Defaults" buttons to the options page.
    This allows you to change which options are set by default when creating a
    new book.
  * Fixed an issue where "Draw frame around images" left an extra pixel of
    empty space on the right and bottom between the image and the frame.
  * Fixed an issue with rotation which could add a row/column of black pixels
    along the top/left of an image.
  * Added a button to the toolbar which opens the options menu. (Icon provided
    by http://pixel-mixer.com)
  * The save/open dialogs now keep track of the last directory saved to/loaded
    from for as long as the program is open.
  * There may be some more I'm not remembering, but that's the gist of it.
